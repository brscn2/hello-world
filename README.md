# hello-world
This is my first repository.

Baris here, i'm a first year computer engineering undergraduate at TOBB Economics and Technology University. I love working on projects and fixing "computer" related problems. Especially if it requires hours and hours of research. Those are the good ones *winky face*. I play drums, sing and love to watch sports. I also love going to the gym.
